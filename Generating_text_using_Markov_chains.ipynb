    "Markov chains, named after Andrey Markov, a stochastic model that depicts a sequence of possible events where predictions or probabilities for the next state are based solely on its previous event state, not the states before. In simple words, the probability that n+1th steps will be x depends only on the nth steps not the complete sequence of steps that came before n. This property is known as Markov Property or Memorylessness. Let us explore our Markov chain with the help of a diagram\n",
